<h1>Mechanical Watches</h1>

<p>
    A mechanical watch is a watch that uses a clockwork mechanism to measure the passage of time. A mechanical watch is driven by a
    mainspring which has to be wound periodically. Its force is transmitted through a series of gears to power the balance wheel, a weighted
    wheel which oscillates back and forth at a constant rate. A device called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_watch">escapment</a>
    releases the watch's wheels to move forward a small amount with each swing of the balance wheel, moving the watch's hands forward at a constant rate.
    This makes the "ticking" sound characteristic of all mechanical watches. Mechanical watches evolved in Europe in the 17th century from spring-powered clocks,
    which appeared in the 15th century. More information about mechanical watches can be found in the corresponding Wikipedia entry.

    <h2>Components</h2>
    <p>
        The internal mechanism of a watch, excluding the face and hands, is called the movement which is composed of the following four parts:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Mainspring</dt>
        <dd>Stores mechanical energy to power the watch.</dd>

        <dt>Gear Train</dt>
        <dd>Transmits the force of the mainspring to the balance wheel and adds up the swings of the balance wheel to get units of seconds,
        minutes and hours.</dd>

        <dt>Balance Wheel</dt>
        <dd>Device that oscillates back and forth, with each swing taking precisely the same amount of time. This is the timekeeping element in the watch.</dd>

        <dt>Escapment</dt>
        <dd>A mechanism that has the dual function of keeping the balance wheel vibrating by giving it a push with each swing, and allowing
        the watch's gears to advance or "escape" by a set amount with each swing. The periodic stopping of the gear train makes the ticking
        sound of a mechanical watch.</dd>

    <h2>Complications</h2>
    <p>
        A watch's additional functions besides basic timekeeping are traditionally referred to as complications. Mechanical watches may have the
        following complications:

            <td>Tourbillon</td>
            <td>The balance wheel is mounted in a rotating cage so that it will experience all positions equally, theoretically eliminating gravitational bias.</td>
